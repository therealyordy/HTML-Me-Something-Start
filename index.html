            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>When covid came around, I was lost and needed to get out there and explore the world. <br>
               So, my partner and I bought a 5th-wheel and traveled the States. We bought a 41 foot <br>
               trailer that was able to take us all around. We started off in Florida, (The Sunshine State) What a great place to live! <br>
