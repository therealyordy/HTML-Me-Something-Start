            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>When covid came around, I was lost and needed to get out there and explore the world <br>
               So, my partner and I bought a 5-wheel and traveled the States. We bought a 41 foot <br>
               trailer that was able to take us all around. I worked from home and my partner is a travel <br>
               nurse. We started off in Florida. The Sunshine State. What a great place to live!br
